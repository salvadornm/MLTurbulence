# A Posteriori

The codes in this folder deal with the a posteriori validation of the NN using OpenFOAM. This comprises the creation of a custom closure model as well as testing different simulation scenarii.

The `pisoFoamNN` directory contains the actual closure model.

Test cases are set up in the `channel_pisoFoamNN` directory.
