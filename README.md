# ML Turbulence

This repository contains the works of:
- Alexander Castagna
- Kacper Janczuk
- George Dixon
- Alvaro Prat

under the supervision of Dr Salvador Navarro-Martinez at Imperial College London.

The aim of the works is to create SGS models for LES based on ANNs.


## A priori

It contains the codes to preprocess data from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Database, train the network, test it and save its architecture in various formats.


## A posteriori_channel

It contains the codes to implement the ANN-based SGS model in OpenFOAM and the relevant simulations, as well as detailed descriptions of the implementation and test cases for the case of channel flows.

## A posteriori_transition

It contains the codes to implement the ANN-based SGS model in OpenFOAM and the relevant simulations for the case of transition flows.

## Legacy

Contains the past work of Alvaro Prat and George Dixon on a priori and a posteriori evaluation of the models in the case of isotropic turbulence.
